# Orkes Templates

A repo for ready-to-use templates for your use cases or business requirements.

How to use the template:

1. Clone the repo and set it up locally on the device.
2. Refer to the [template docs](https://orkes.io/content/category/templates) for running your workflow from the ready-made template.
3. There are some custom templates that you can use for your use cases or business requirements. For example [custom-fraud-detection](./custom_fraud_detector) with [this workflow](https://play.orkes.io/taskDef/custom-fraud-detection).

You can further refer the docs for the [Orkes CLI](https://orkes.io/content/) to run the workflow.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The workflows are run using the [Orkes Playground](https://play.orkes.io) and more can be found in the [Orkes Templates](https://play.orkes.io/workflowExplorer) section.
